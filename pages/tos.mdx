### Changes to Terms of Service and AUP

Whost IT Solutions's Terms of Service and AUP are both subject to change at any time and
without notice at the sole discretion of Whost IT Solutions. A change in policy shall not be
grounds for early contract termination or non-payment. Client recognizes that the nature of
the service supplied and the initial rates and charges have been communicated to the client.
The client is aware that from time to time rates may change based on availability of
hardware, overall market conditions or other factors. Clients will be notified of any
increases in rates or charges prior to the billing renewal date on which such increases will
take effect.

### Non-Payment/Service Interruption

Services interrupted for non-payment may be subject to a 10% late fee. Data stored on a
client's services will not be available to the client until reconnection is established or
alternative arrangements are made to the sole satisfaction of Whost IT Solutions. Clients
deactivated for non-payment or charge-back are subject to their data being destroyed ten

by performing a charge-back, then the client agrees to pay an 'Administrative Fee' of $200 in
addition to original amount of funds which were reclaimed.

functioning. Whost IT Solutions does not offer software support of any kind. Whost IT
Solutions does not provide software support/troubleshooting for the software items chosen
from the order form. Whost IT Solutions only ensures the correct default installation of any
software item chosen from the order form, and in no way assumes liability for the

provide enhanced software support (including kernel configuration) for an additional fee.
Please contact sales or support for enhanced support pricing. Each client is eligible for one
(1) complimentary operating system (.OS.) reload per billing cycle; each additional OS reload

### Abuse/Spam/Bulk Email Policy

Whost IT Solutions reserves the right to deny mail delivery from any servers hosted on our
network if they are believed to be involved in SPAM or SPIM activities. This includes spam
support services such as DNS or spamvertised web sites. Our abuse department will locate
abusive servers based on public blacklist monitors, abuse reporting from external networks,
and other means. If our abuse department receives a report or otherwise becomes aware of
abuse-related activities active on our network, we will identify the server the abuse was
initially sent from (via IP and in some cases by domain) and create a ticket on behalf of the
user who occupies the server with information regarding the abuse such as logs describing
the abuse and an explanation of what abuse took place.

#### The following actions will be taken on a case-by-case basis:
-An abuse ticket serves as notification that our abuse department has received reports of
abuse originating from the server. We require a client response to ALL abuse tickets within
24 hours of the ticket being opened. Typically no service will be suspended or filtered within
the first 24 hours of an abuse ticket being opened. If a response is not received within 24
hours, or the server is determined to be abusive (or likely to be abusive in the case of spam
blacklistings) after the ticket is opened, our abuse technicians may filter or disable ports or
IPs assigned to the server temporarily to prevent further abuse until a response is received.
-If a response has not been received to an abuse ticket within 7 days of being opened, the
server is eligible for suspension and may be completely disabled until we receive a response.
-Habitual neglect of abuse occurring on a client's server may lead to service termination or
longer-term port filters as some blacklistings can take several weeks to time out or be
removed.
-Whost IT Solutions reserves the right to refuse services to any client whose account(s) have
been fined or terminated for abuse-related activities. If an IP range or IP address has been
blacklisted as a result of excessive abuse reports, Whost IT Solutions reserves the right to
issue a fine of $200 and immediately terminate the service.
Compromised servers issued abuse notifications: If our abuse department suspects that
abuse reports associated with a client's server are a result of the server's security being
compromised, our abuse department will offer the following options:
-At the discretion of our abuse department, we will typically offer the ability to log in to the server and remedy the security compromise while leaving the abusive traffic filtered.
-Offer an Operating System reinstallation, setting the configuration back to the original state
it was provisioned in.
-If Operating System reinstallation is not accepted as an option, Whost IT Solutions may
offer to manually retrieve/repair the files on the server, at a fee to be assessed and paid
prior to any work being done.
Habitual security compromises that result in abusive traffic being transmitted or received
from the server may result in service termination.
If a client wishes to dispute any abuse reports, or any fine assessed in connection with
abuse reports or blacklistings, the client must provide Whost IT Solutions with an
explanation via Whost IT Solutions's ticketing system within 10 days of the abuse ticket
being opened.

### DMCA Complaints

Whost IT Solutions handles any and all Digital Millennium Copyright Act (.DMCA.)
complaints very seriously, and will thoroughly investigate each complaint received. Whost IT
Solutions reserves the right to pursue civil remedies for any costs associated with the
investigation of a substantiated policy violation.

#### The following actions will be taken on a case-by-case basis:

-A ticket is opened as a warning, providing 24 hours to resolve the situation.
-After 24 hours with no client response, connection to the IP address from the DMCA
complaint will be disabled at the network level. At this time, Whost IT Solutions reserves the
right to assess a $25 fine.
-After 72 hours with no resolution, services on the server in question will be suspended.
-After 7 days of being suspended and the issue not having been resolved, services on the
server in question will be canceled and an Abuse Charge of $200 will be placed on the
account. All client data will be destroyed immediately after the cancellation date.
-Users who violate this policy and fail to resolve the situation within 24 hours agree that in
addition to these administrative penalties, they will pay .Research Fees' not to exceed $50
per hour that Whost IT Solutions personnel must spend to investigate the matter, to be
charged only if claims are found to be valid.

### Bandwidth Usage/Overages

Clients agree to pay any and all bandwidth overage charges accrued on their account from
the previous billing cycle. Bandwidth overage charges are billed per gigabyte at a rate of
$0.25 (twenty five cents) over the allotted bandwidth on the service. Whost IT Solutions
reserves the right to suspend any account which does not pay bandwidth overage charges
within 15 days. Whost IT Solutions is not responsible for spikes in bandwidth that are caused
on a client's service for any reason. Client assumes liability for all bandwidth to and from
their services. If issued an expected to exceed bandwidth notification, clients are required to
make payment arrangements within 24 hours of that notification to prevent possible service
interruption until adequate arrangements are made. These arrangements may include being
required to pro-actively upgrade bandwidth.

###Payment Verification

Clients agree to submit to identity verification measures, designed for both the security of
the client as well as the security of Whost IT Solutions. The identity verification measures
may include the faxing of two forms of government issued identification to Whost IT
Solutions, as well as a front and back copy of the credit card used for payment, as well as a
copy of a utility bill with the billing address. In certain circumstances additional identity
verification may be required, in addition to the previously listed forms.
